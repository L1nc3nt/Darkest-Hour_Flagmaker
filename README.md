# Darkest-Hour_Flagmaker
-= A Python script that makes flag graphics for Darkest Hour and other old Paradox Interactive games. =-
Put the flag files you want in the input file with the 3 letter TAG as the file name!
If you have a dark flag I recommend increasing the brightness; using luminosity curves preferably, for best results.
The program should then resize and work on the flags using PIL putting the shields in output/shields and the animated flags in output/flags
I've included 4 shield styles: Hearts of Iron 2, Darkest Hour FULL, EU3 complete(based on the forum avatars), and Victoria 1.
To use these just rename the shield files to Shield_Blank.png and Shield_SCREEN.png, if you don't want to use screen just use a blank png.
Enjoy!!
